                                  Installation

The directory src contains the following files:

 1. mg0.f                           module that sets precision
 2. solver.f                        the solver routines
 3. driver.f                        graphics and driver routines
 4. mgvio.f                         SG interface
 5. xgui.c                          X-Windows interface
 6. atest.f                         main driver program
 7. xgui_stubs.c, mgvio_stubs.f     (mostly) empty routines 
 8. Makefile                        a simple generic makefile
 9. Makefile_osx                    an example makefile for OS X  

You can set the precision in the module mthdef in the file mg0.f. This
module is machine dependent, but should work as provided in most
environments. Set the integer arithmetic to single or
double precision as desired; the default is single precision.
Floating point can be single, double, or quadruple precision
(if supported); the default is double precision.

If you want to incorporate the solver into your own environment,
just compile and link the files mg0.f and solver.f with your existing 
application, and call the appropriate subroutines as described in the 
documentation.

If you want to use the included test driver, your environment
must include Fortran90 and C compilers as well as X-Windows 
and SG. The X-Windows GUI is based on the Motif widget set and X11R6.
SG (socket graphics) is an OpenGL display tool written by Michael Holst;
it is available at http://scicomp.ucsd.edu/~mholst/

All calls to X-Windows routines are made by routines in the file xgui.c.
If X-Windows is unavailable, empty replacement routines in the file
xgui_stubs.c can be used in place of xgui.c. (e.g. set X11_INTERFACE to
xgui_stubs in the Makefile). In this case, X-Windows libraries are not 
needed to resolve external references, but the X-Windows interface is disabled.

Similarly, if SG is not available or not desired, one can use the file
mgvio_stubs.f in place of mgvio.f. Then the maloc library is not needed 
to resolve external references, and the SG and bh file graphics interfaces 
are disabled. 

To make an executable, you must compile mg0.f, solver.f, driver.f, mgvio.f,
xgui.c, and atest.f, and link the resulting object files with the Xm, 
Xt, and X11 libraries (X-Windows), and the maloc library (SG). 
A generic Makefile is provided (along with a sample Makefile for OS X). 
To use the Makefile, specify paths for the indicated include files and 
libraries, and set compiler flags as necessary.

                                  SG Interface

To use the SG (OpenGL) interface in Hb, first start up one or more
(up to 4) SG display tools. Click on the button marked `socket' and choose
INET TCP/IP Socket K, where K=0,1,2,3. Be sure each instance of SG is 
associated with a unique socket number. Choose the corresponding socket
number for graphics output (Hb parameters  GDEVCE and MDEVCE).
If SG is running on a different computer from Hb, be sure to set the Hb
parameter SGHOST to the name of the host machine (default is `localhost').
