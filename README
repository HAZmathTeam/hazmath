                         HAZMATH		              

This package contains simple C functions to generate finite-element
discretizations of Poisson's Equation, Maxwell's Equations, and 
other PDEs. It also contains iterative solvers, including standard
Krylov and Multigrid methods, as well as linking to MULTIGRAPH and
SUITESPARSE direct/iterative linear solver libraries.  Several example
driver routines are contained in the "examples" directory.  

-------------------------------------------------------------
Quick start: 1. Edit "haz_config/hazmath.mk" as needed.
	     2. For more information type "make help"
