                         HAZMATH		              

This package contains simple C functions to generate finite-element
discretizations of Poisson's Equation, the Heat equation, Stokes' 
Equations, Maxwell's Equations, and other PDEs. It also contains 
iterative solvers, including standard Krylov and Multigrid methods, 
as well as links to MULTIGRAPH and SUITESPARSE direct/iterative linear 
solver libraries.  Several example driver routines are contained in the 
"examples" directory.
