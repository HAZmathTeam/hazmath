To make the executables for the examples:
   1. edit the variables in examples.mk to match your system.
   2. change to the directory with an example and type "make", e.g.:
      cd basic_elliptic ; make
   3. Note that if you want to link to an external package, such as SuiteSparse
      make sure that HAZMATH was compiled appropriately and modify the makefile in
      specific examples directory as needed.
