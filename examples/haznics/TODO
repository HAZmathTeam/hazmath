Just some brief comments

1. 
params: 
   - it would be convenient with something like
     init_param = input_param(inputfile="some_default_file_under_haznics")   

   - set_param should be in module haznics

2. 
Things should be moved to hseig/cbc.block/fenics_ii in a practical way 

3. 
A clean Poisson demo without any fractional stuff, just the use of hazmath/haznics

4. 
A clean Stokes demo without any fractional stuff, just the use of hazmath/haznics


5. 
Is hseig needed for Poisson-Babuska with rational approximation ?  
Correspnding demo in hseig or what? 

6. 
In mixed Darcy we can use multilevel?  

7. 
Nice demo for rational approximation of sums of fractional powers, just as a function

8. 
Simple Darcy-Stokes problem
