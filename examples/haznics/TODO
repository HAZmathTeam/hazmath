Just some brief comments

0. 
All packages, cbc.block, ulfy, hseig etc should have a spesific version we download. 
Not git. Things will change down the line 

1. 
params: 
   - it would be convenient with something like
     init_param = input_param(inputfile="some_default_file_under_haznics")
     (2021-07-23 Ana:
         DONE - there is now a custom constructor for input_param,
         it sets the default values with hazmath init function
         (see src/utilities/parameters.c and src/haznics/haznics.i)
     )
     KAM: 
     Can I also ask that there is a input file in cbc.block that initialize all parameters
     such that down the line, when hazmath has changed, I know that I use the same default parameters
     as I did back in some previous version :) 

   - set_param should be in module haznics
     (2021-07-23 Ana:
         should we make helper.py with python helper functions (like helper.c)?
     )
     KAM: I think we can probably add some Python code to the .i file. Also preferably 
     an input file that is read during the initialization of the module.  
     The swig directive for adding py-code is: 
     %pythoncode %{
     %}

2.
Things should be moved to hseig/cbc.block/fenics_ii in a practical way

3.
A clean Poisson demo without any fractional stuff, just the use of hazmath/haznics
I suggest poisson.py from cbc.block, just using hazmath
(2021-07-23 Ana:
    DONE.
)
KAM: Looks good. 

4.
A clean Stokes demo without any fractional stuff, just the use of hazmath/haznics
I suggest stokes.py from cbc.block, just using hazmath
(2021-07-23 Ana:
    Need to still figure out setting up kernel for AMG in hazmath.
)
KAM: I'm not sure I understand. 

5.
Is hseig needed for Poisson-Babuska with rational approximation ?
Correspnding demo in hseig or what?
(2021-07-23 Ana:
    It's not needed. I've updated demo_poisson.py in examples/haznics/)
)

6.
In mixed Darcy we can use multilevel?
(2021-07-23 Ana:
    In cbc.block/demo/mixedpoisson.py, we use AMG from hazmath.
    Miro also put the ones with hypre.
    Do we need also a version with HX div-div preconditioner from hazmath?
)
KAM: perhaps we have a pure Hdiv demo, demonstrating the HX stuff. 

7.
Nice demo for rational approximation of sums of fractional powers, just as a function
(2021-07-26 Ana:
    See examples/haznics/demo_sumfractional.py. Is something like this ok?
)
KAM: it looks good. 
Can we have one RA demo also of just a function (no matrix). 
Say we have f(x) = a sqrt(x) + b 1/sqrt(x) or something. 

8.
Simple Darcy-Stokes problem
(2021-07-23 Ana:
    DONE. Not sure if it's simple enough though. See examples/haznics/demo_darcy_stokes.py
)
