Just some brief comments

0. 
All packages, cbc.block, ulfy, hseig etc should have a spesific version we download. 
Not git. Things will change down the line 

1. DONE
params: 
   - it would be convenient with something like
     init_param = input_param(inputfile="some_default_file_under_haznics")

   - set_param should be in module haznics

2.
Things should be moved to hseig/cbc.block/fenics_ii in a practical way

3. DONE
A clean Poisson demo without any fractional stuff, just the use of hazmath/haznics
I suggest poisson.py from cbc.block, just using hazmath

4.
A clean Stokes demo without any fractional stuff, just the use of hazmath/haznics
I suggest stokes.py from cbc.block, just using hazmath
(2021-07-23 Ana:
    Need to still figure out setting up kernel for AMG in hazmath.
)
KAM: I'm not sure I understand. 

5. DONE (not needed)
Is hseig needed for Poisson-Babuska with rational approximation ?
Correspnding demo in hseig or what?

6.
In mixed Darcy we can use multilevel?
(2021-07-23 Ana:
    In cbc.block/demo/mixedpoisson.py, we use AMG from hazmath.
    Miro also put the ones with hypre.
    Do we need also a version with HX div-div preconditioner from hazmath?
)
KAM: perhaps we have a pure Hdiv demo, demonstrating the HX stuff. 

7. DONE
Nice demo for rational approximation of sums of fractional powers, just as a function

8. DONE
Simple Darcy-Stokes problem
