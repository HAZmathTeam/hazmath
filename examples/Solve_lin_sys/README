README for example "gen_lin_solve". 

This directory contains an example for the solution of linear systems
with general non-symmetric or symmetric indefinite matrices using the
mulitgraph method due Randolph E Bank or a direct solver from Suite
Sparse.

For other linear systems (such as SPD corresponding to elliptic
equations) refer to the other examples included with this software.
