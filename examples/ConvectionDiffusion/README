README for example “multigraph_solve”. 

This directory contains an example for the solution of linear systems
with general non-symmetric or symmetric indefinite matrices using the
mulitgraph method due Randolph E Bank.

To build the executable you need to specify the location of multigraph-2.0 sources. 

For other linear systems (such as SPD corresponding to elliptic
equations) refer to the other examples included with this software.
