# HAZMATH: Testing the rational approximation of functions. 

---

- to make the hazmath library from this directory:
     

- to test AAA algorithm:
    - in the makefile set **SRC_SRCFILE = test_aaa**
    - type "make clean ; make"
    - run "./test_aaa" as
     ./test_aaa.ex <<EOF_FRAC >frac_aaa.m
           -0.50 0.50 1.00 0.25 0.00001 1.00
     EOF_FRAC 
 
- to test the BRASIL algorithm:
-
